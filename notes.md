# Story of CV/life story

http://www.cns.nyu.edu/malab/static/files/publications/2017%20Ma.pdf

I guess I just don't know how to _organize_ this.  General points:

* It's really uncomfortable: normal academic discourse = being in control,
  projecting authority.  It's really kind of strange to express that
  vulnerability in this kind of setting when we're always taught that it's
  something that needs to be hidden.
* Also have to resist the urge to tell a coherent story.  So this is going to be
  a little disorganized, and I'm just gonna try to roll with that.

SO I guess my plan is, literally, to try and tell the stories behind the actual
document of the CV (which in a sense is supposed to be my "official" life story)
  * highlight a few themes to start
  * go through my CV 

## Themes

* Role of luck in the whole thing.  Right place at the right time.
* Related: mentorship.  Both good and bad.
* Privelege: particular upbringing plus I'm cis straight white dude.
* unhealthy habits and attitudes that have helped me in some ways but I'm trying
  to jettison because they're damaging me.

# Things that don't show up explicitly

Procastination and imposter syndrome, yup 100%.  Constantly worried about how
I'm perceived.

I've thought _constantly_ about quitting academia.  I still think about it.

## Overwork, depression.

I was kind of surprised when I was looking back on my CV how many of the things
on there remind me of really dark times.  I'm not sure that's healthy.

I've found therapy really helpful in some cases.  I was brought up to believe
that work is really the only thing that matters in your life.


## one good idea? / feeling very scattered

really hard time settling down with any one topic or field.  always worried that
I'm unsuited to diving deeply into things because there's an element of real
risk and vulnerability to getting deep enough into anything that you don't know
what you're doing.  I'm still really uncomfortable with that.  It's worked to my
advantage sometimes but that's basically luck: I happen to be randomly
interested in things that are in demand at the moment.  That's not to say that
every hunch/idea/obsession I've had has been productive or useful.  **lesson**:
In fact a big part of my journey has been learning to let go of things that I
think are super cool but aren't going anywhere.

Related to this: often feel stuck in my own head.  Communicating clearly is
really really important and so hard.  There's a really hard decision problem
in deciding whether (or which of) the things I'm really excited about at the
moment are worth developing enough to make sense to other people.  Also this is
not always (subjectively or objectively) rewarding work, or it's a high-risk
strategy.

Many things I think are super interesting are not going to be interesting to
other people without a lot of explanation.

## Pipeline

At the moment I am just completely overwhelmed because I have too much stuff in
the pipeline.  I'm learning something about myself which is that I'd rather have
one or two projects that I can think deeply about and take my time.  But I also
struggle with getthing things to the point where they feel _done_.

# Job Market

exhausting and random.  there are many necessary elements to success but nothing
that's sufficient.  hiring is a _bet_ about your (potential) career trajectory.

but...realy exciting chance to think deeply about what _you're_ really
interested in.

# Lessons

Procrastination can be okay, sometimes it'll lead somewhere interesting.

Don't accept anybody's particular ideas about how much of yourself you shoudl
give to your profession (just in general).  Life is all about tradeoffs and you
have to figure out the right ones for _you_.
